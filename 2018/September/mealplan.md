### Enchilada Sauce

1. Over medium-low heat, heat the oil, flour and chili powder together in a large pot. Allow to cook for a minute or 
two, stirring to form a paste and making sure that the flour doesn't burn. 
2. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a slow simmer. Stir well to combine and dissolve tomato paste in water.
3. Allow to cook for at least 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste, and add more spices as desired.
