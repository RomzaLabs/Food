## Dinners

### Enchilada Sauce

1. Over medium-low heat, heat the oil, flour and chili powder together in a large pot. Allow to cook for a minute or 
two, stirring to form a paste and making sure that the flour doesn't burn. 
2. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a slow simmer. Stir well to combine and dissolve tomato paste in water.
3. Allow to cook for at least 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste, and add more spices as desired.

### Red Chicken Enchiladas

1. Preheat oven to 350˚F. Grease a 9x13 baking dish.
2. In a small bowl, combine all ingredients for Mexican spice blend. Set aside.
3. Fill a large pot halfway with water. Add salt and bring to a boil. Add chicken breast, stemmed cilantro, onion, 
garlic, and peppercorns and return to a boil. Cover the pot with a lid, lower the heat, and simmer for 20 minutes.
4. Remove chicken to a bowl and discard contents of pot. Using two forks, shred the chicken apart.
5. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium high heat. Add onions and sauté until they become translucent and 
start to brown.
6. Add the chicken, green chilis, el pato, and Mexican spice blend to the pot, stirring to combine. Cook for 2-3 
minutes until heated through.
7. While chicken mixture is cooking, spread 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the baking dish. Pour 
about 1/4 cup into a shallow bowl.
8. Warm the corn tortillas on the stove or in the microwave (30 seconds).
9. Assemble the enchiladas: Dip tortillas into the sauce in the shallow bowl and shake gently to remove excess. Spoon 
about 1/4 cup of chicken mixture onto each tortilla and top with a pinch of the shredded cheeses. Gently roll up each 
tortilla and place in the baking dish. Top with remaining enchilada sauce and cheese.
10. Cook for 15 minutes, until cheese has melted and sauce is slightly bubbling around the edges.
11. Garnish with cilantro leaves, chives and sour cream if desired.
